              2. What are the different ways to manage a state in a React
              application?

            <ul className="pl-2 lg:pl-[270px]">
              <li> 1.Local state</li>
              <li>2. Global state</li>

              <li> 4.URL state</li>
            </ul>
            <p className=" pl-2 lg:pl-[270px] pt-2">
              1.<u>Local (UI) state</u> Local state is data we manage in one or
              another component. Local state is most often managed in React
              using the useState hook. For example, local state would be needed
              to show or hide a modal component or to track values for a form
              component, such as form submission, when the form is disabled and
              the values of a formâ€™s inputs.
            </p>
            <p className=" pl-2 lg:pl-[270px] pt-2">
              2.<u>Global state</u> Global state is data we manage across
              multiple components. Global state is necessary when we want to get
              and update data anywhere in our app, or in multiple components at
              least. A common example of global state is authenticated user
              state. If a user is logged into our app, it is necessary to get
              and change their data throughout our application. Sometimes state
              we think should be local might become global.
            </p>
            <p className=" pl-2 lg:pl-[270px] pt-2">
              3.<u>Server state</u> Data that comes from an external server that
              must be integrated with our UI state. Server state is a simple
              concept, but can be hard to manage alongside all of our local and
              global UI state. There are several pieces of state that must be
              managed every time you fetch or update data from an external
              server, including loading and error state. Fortunately there are
              tools such as SWR and React Query that make managing server state
              much easier.
            </p>
            <p className=" pl-2 lg:pl-[270px] pt-2">
              4.<u>URL state</u> Data that exists on our URLs, including the
              pathname and query parameters. URL state is often missing as a
              category of state, but it is an important one. In many cases, a
              lot of major parts of our application rely upon accessing URL
              state. Try to imagine building a blog without being able to fetch
              a post based off of its slug or id that is located in the URL!
              There are undoubtedly more pieces of state that we could identify,
              but these are the major categories worth focusing on for most
              applications you build.

              3. How does prototypical inheritance work?
            </h2>
            <p className=" pl-2 lg:pl-[270px] pt-2">
              Simply put, prototypical inheritance refers to the ability to
              access object properties from another object. We use a JavaScript
              prototype to add new properties and methods to an existing object
              constructor. We can then essentially tell our JS code to inherit
              properties from a prototype. Prototypical inheritance allows us to
              reuse the properties or methods from one JavaScript object to
              another through a reference pointer function.
